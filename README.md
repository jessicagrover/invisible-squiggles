# invisible-squiggles README

This is the README for the VSCode extension "invisible-squiggles". It provides a command to toggle the visibility of squiggles in the editor.

To use the extension, [install it](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=michen00.invisible-squiggles) from the VSCode extension marketplace. Then press `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P` to launch the command palette and type `Toggle Squiggles` to select the command. This will toggle the visibility of squiggles in the editor.

It is similar to [Disable Error and Warning Squiggles](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=modan.disable-error-squiggles) ([repo](https://github.com/danMoksh/disable-error-and-warning-squiggles)), but also hides info squiggles in addition to error and warning squiggles.
